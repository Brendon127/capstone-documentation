\chapter{Introduction}

\section{Purpose}
This document provides an in depth overview of our plans to implement object recognition, 
tracking and 2D mapping as part of the FMDS (Follow Me Drones System). 
The system will be used to aid rangers in the field while scouting areas of suspected poaching/intrusion. 
A drone employing our software will patrol with the ranger at a safe height while surveying the area 
for objects which might aid the ranger and increase their scouting efficiency.   

\section{Project Scope}
% $<$Provide a short description of the software being specified and its purpose,
%including relevant benefits, objectives, and goals. Relate the software to
% corporate goals or business strategies. If a separate vision and scope document
%is available, refer to it rather than duplicating its contents here.$>$

The primary aim of the FMDS is to provide support to a ranger in the field by having the drone surveying the surrounding area for objects and sending notifications to the ranger upon identification. This will increase the rangers efficiency by providing an aerial overview of the surroundings and identifying objects that the ranger could potentially miss.

While the drone is surveying it will periodically take a snapshot of the area for later use in creating a 2D map.
